                With the comparison between pedestrian counts and the tram departure frequency, there is a huge gap on
                Friday. Which the frequency of departure does not meet the need, therefore, specifically on Friday, the
                tram departure frequency should increase to meet the high volume of traffic.

                Travelling within the city currently relies on the tram network and train network, but Melbourne's
                distant suburbs rely heavily on the Bus for travel.

                Unlike Melbourne's train and tram networks, the Melbourne government allows buses to be operated by
                private companies and to compete freely in the marketplace

                The bar chart shows how many buses (including night buses, etc.)
                start their first trip in each hour.
                Most of the buses are proportional to the number of people, but
                it seems that we can slightly reduce the number of buses from 9am to 11am.

                A route service is a group of trips that are displayed to riders.
                It can be seen that during weekdays, foot traffic and route service
                are proportional, but the decline in service on weekends is much greater
                than the decline in foot traffic.
