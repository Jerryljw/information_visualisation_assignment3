                    Travelling within the city currently relies on the tram network and train network, but Melbourne's
                    distant suburbs rely heavily on the Bus for travel.

                <p>
                    Unlike Melbourne's train and tram networks, the Melbourne government allows buses to be operated by
                    private companies and to compete freely in the marketplace

                    Melbourne Bike Share is a joint RACV/Victorian Government bicycle hire scheme. It allows commuters
