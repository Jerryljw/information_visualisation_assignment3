            A world-class transport system is critical to a liveable, prosperous and sustainable city. Melbourne as a
            world-class city must be supported by an excellent transport system to accommodate the increased number of

            transport options in Central Melbourne and provide some suggestions for better integration of transportation
            into people's lives and the convenience of people’s lives.

                Travelling within the city currently relies on the tram network and train network, but Melbourne's
